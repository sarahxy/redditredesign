# redditredesign
WDD Fall 2015 Project 1

In general, the goal of our redesign of the Reddit page was to retain the basic usability, color scheme, and feel of the original Reddit, but clean up the interface to be more aesthetically pleasing and accessible. Our paper prototypes for the pages went through several iterations as we evaluated our own skills and the responses from various friends who were regular Reddit users on their preferences in terms of usability for the site; none of the members of our group were regular Reddit users.

The header (navigation bar, logo, etc.) and the footer (back-to-top button, miscellaneous links) kept much of the same information from the original, but took out links (especially the small ones in the header) that were too small to access. We made all links much larger and more visible, so that users would find the buttons easier to click.

We completely got rid of the sidebar in the original website because the sidebar interfered with the content that most users focus on. As a result, we allocated a lot of that information to the header, where it would be out of the way of the content. We minimized everything else outside of the header, so that the content would be the most prominent feature on all of the pages.

We kept the same calming but business-like blue of the original Reddit. The font is “Dosis”, which adds a modern feel.

List / Home View (index.html)

The top post on the page is the highest trending and most recent in the past hour, so that users can find hot and new information quickly. The rest of the posts below are less clumped and more spread out and easily distinguishable through the use of boxes. We displayed the title and upvotes more prominently, and the comments and share buttons are off to the side where they are more easily clicked than the small text buttons used in the original site.

UNFINISHED: The original plan was to have the same nested format, but have previews of comments instead of everything openly displayed, so that the audience of the page could quickly and easily browse through comments and only open threads they were interested in reading, instead of spending a ton of time simply scrolling.


Search View (item.html)

The search bar is the most prominent part of the page, so it is centered at the very top. The page displayed shows a generated list of results for the search “Star Wars”, and with the use of color and spacing, information like the title and the upvotes as well as the subreddit are very quickly accessible to the eye. The search results are very text-heavy as opposed to image-heavy.
